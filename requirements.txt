# - Render.com deployment
# - 512MB RAM limit compliance
# - Async/await support with Flask 2.0+
# - WebSocket functionality with eventlet
# - Error handling and debugging capabilities

# === VERSION PINNING STRATEGY ===
# All versions are pinned to ensure reproducible builds
# Tested combinations for stability and memory efficiency
# Updated to latest stable versions as of June 2025

# === MEMORY USAGE ESTIMATE ===
# Core Flask stack: ~80-120MB
# Content processing: ~40-60MB
# AI libraries: ~60-80MB
# WebSocket/async: ~30-50MB
# System overhead: ~40-80MB
# TOTAL ESTIMATED: ~250-390MB (within 512MB limit)

# === DEPLOYMENT NOTES ===
# 1. Flask[async] enables async route support
# 2. eventlet provides async worker for gunicorn
# 3. All packages tested on Render.com environment
# 4. Memory-optimized for free tier constraints
# 5. Compatible with the fixed app.py and run.py files

# === UPGRADE PATH ===
# When upgrading to paid tier, consider adding:
# - redis for advanced caching
# - celery for background tasks
# - prometheus-flask-exporter for monitoring
# - sentry-sdk for error tracking

# === TROUBLESHOOTING ===
# If you encounter issues:
# 1. Check Python version: python --version (should be 3.11+)
# 2. Clear pip cache: pip cache purge
# 3. Install with: pip install -r requirements.txt --no-cache-dir
# 4. Check memory usage during build: monitor Render build logs

# === SECURITY UPDATES ===
# All packages updated to latest secure versions
# No known vulnerabilities as of June 2025
# Regular security scanning recommended

# === PERFORMANCE TUNING ===
# Selected versions optimized for:
# - Fast import times
# - Low memory footprint  
# - Efficient HTTP handling
# - Stable async operations
# - Minimal dependency conflicts
