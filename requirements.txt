# 3. Development packages are commented out for production builds
# 4. All versions are pinned for reproducible builds
# 5. Packages are grouped by functionality for easier maintenance

# === RENDER.COM SPECIFIC NOTES ===
# - All packages are compatible with Render.com's Python environment
# - Memory usage is optimized for free tier limitations
# - Build times are optimized by using lightweight alternatives where possible
# - No system-level dependencies that require custom buildpacks
